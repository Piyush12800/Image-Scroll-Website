Welcome to the GitHub repository for creating a website with a parallax effect using only HTML and CSS.

This website is built using only HTML and CSS and utilizes the CSS property "background-attachment" along with "background-position" to create a parallax effect on the background image.

To use this code, simply clone or download the repository and open the index.html file in your browser. The parallax effect is created using the different class in the CSS file. You can replace the background image with your own image by updating the background-image property in the CSS File.

Additionally, if you'd like to adjust the speed of the parallax effect or the position of the background image, you can play around with the background-attachment and background-position properties respectively.

You can use this as a starting point for your own website and customize it as you see fit.

If you have any questions or issues, please feel free to open an issue in this repository or contact me directly. Enjoy!
